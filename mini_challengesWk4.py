# Extracting Sub-Strings Practice #1
# Extract the first word of the following sentence using slicing, and display it on the screen:
text =  "Controlling complexity is the essence of programming"
substring = text.find("Controlling")
print(substring)
substring = text[0:12]
print(substring)
# Hint: "Controlling" is 11 characters long


# Extracting Sub-Strings Practice #2
# Take every third character starting from the ninth to the end of the sentence, and print the result.
text2 = "Never trust a computer you can't throw out a window"
substring = text2[9:-1:3]
print(substring)
# Extracting Sub-Strings Practice #3
# Reverses the position of all the characters in the following sentence and displays the result on the screen.
text3= "It's great to work with computers. They don't argue, they remember everything and they don't drink your beer"
print(text3[::-1])

# Print the following text in uppercase, using the specific string method:
text4 = "Especially in electronic communications, writing in all caps is equivalent to yelling."
print(text4.upper())

# sentence = "Especially in electronic communications, writing in all caps is equivalent to yelling."
text5 = "Especially in electronic communications, writing in all caps is equivalent to yelling."
print(text5.lower())

# String Methods Practice #2
# Join the following list into a string, separating each item with a space. Use the appropriate list/string method, and display the result.
word_list = ["Simple","is","better","than","complex."]
joined_list=" ".join(word_list)
print(joined_list)

# String Methods Practice #3
# Replace in the following sentence:
text6 = "If the implementation is hard to explain, it might be a bad idea."
new_text = text6.replace("hard","easy").replace("bad","good")
print(new_text)

# the following pairs of words:
# "hard" --> "easy"
# "bad" --> "good"
# and display the sentence with both words modified.

# Concatenate the text "Repetition" 15 times and display the result on the screen.
# Luckily, you know that strings are multipliable and you can do this activity in a simple and elegant way.
repitition = "Repitition " * 15
print(repitition)
